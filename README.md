Overview
The projects contains code developed to meet the requirements of a specific grading rubric for an academic or professional evaluation. The primary goal of the code was to address the outlined criteria in the rubric to ensure all objectives were met for evaluation purposes. While the code is functional and achieves the desired outcomes, it may not necessarily represent the most efficient or optimized approach to solving the problem.

Key Considerations
Grading Rubric Focus

The main objective was to satisfy all the detailed requirements specified in the grading rubric, which influenced decisions regarding structure, implementation, and methodology.
Code readability, adherence to specific coding conventions, and inclusion of required elements (such as comments or documentation) were prioritized to align with rubric expectations.
Efficiency vs. Compliance

In some instances, more straightforward or efficient solutions may have been possible. However, choices were made to ensure the code explicitly demonstrated the skills and techniques required by the rubric.
The project may include redundant or less streamlined approaches intentionally, to showcase knowledge of specific methods or algorithms.
Future Improvements
Given the primary focus on meeting rubric requirements, there are potential opportunities to improve the code for real-world applications, including:

Refactoring to enhance performance and reduce complexity.
Streamlining logic to minimize redundancy.
Applying best practices for scalable and maintainable code.
